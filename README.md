## Hi! My Name is David, I am a hobby developer that specializes in Web development, but i also programm apps in python and i am trying to learn C++ for micro proccessor coding, But because of how I started programming I also have some knowledge of circuits, assembly, machine code and computer architecture(thats why some of my webpages are cpu design or ciruit design oriented).

- Fun fact: i got into programming via making a redstone computer in minecraft
